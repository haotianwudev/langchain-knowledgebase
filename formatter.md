Of course. You can easily use Prettier for your Node.js files and Black for your Python files in the same project. The key is to configure each tool to handle only its specific file types and then integrate them into your workflow.

The best way to automate this is with a combination of **pre-commit hooks** and **editor settings**.

-----

### \#\# 1. Configure Each Formatter

First, ensure each formatter is set up correctly for its language.

#### **Prettier (for Node.js)**

1.  **Install Prettier:** Add it to your project's `devDependencies`.

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev prettier
    ```

2.  **Create a Configuration File:** Create a `.prettierrc.json` file in your project's root. You can leave it empty `{}` to use the defaults or add your own rules. This file signals to editors and tools that your project uses Prettier.

    ```json
    {
      "semi": true,
      "singleQuote": true,
      "trailingComma": "es5"
    }
    ```

3.  **Create an Ignore File:** Create a `.prettierignore` file to prevent Prettier from touching files it shouldn't, like your Python virtual environment.

    ```
    # Node
    node_modules
    dist

    # Python
    .venv
    __pycache__
    ```

#### **Black (for Python)**

1.  **Install Black:** Install it using pip. It's best to manage this with a `requirements.txt` file or similar.

    ```bash
    pip install black
    ```

2.  **Create a Configuration File:** Configure Black in your `pyproject.toml` file. This is the modern standard for Python project configuration.

    ```toml
    [tool.black]
    line-length = 88
    target-version = ['py311']
    ```

### \#\# 2. Automate Formatting with Pre-Commit Hooks

Using the `pre-commit` framework is the most robust way to enforce formatting for both languages before code is even committed. It's a Python tool, but it manages hooks for any language.

1.  **Install `pre-commit`:**

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2.  **Create a Configuration File:** In your project root, create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. This file tells `pre-commit` which formatters to run on which files.

    ```yaml
    repos:
    # Hooks for Prettier (Node.js, JSON, YAML, etc.)
    -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-prettier
        rev: v3.1.0 # Use a specific, recent version
        hooks:
        -   id: prettier
            types_or: [javascript, jsx, ts, tsx, json, yaml, markdown] # Specify file types

    # Hook for Black (Python)
    -   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
        rev: 24.8.0 # Use a specific, recent version
        hooks:
        -   id: black
    ```

3.  **Install the Git Hook:** This command reads your config file and sets up the hook in your local `.git` directory.

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

Now, whenever you run `git commit`, `pre-commit` will automatically run Prettier on your staged Node.js/JSON/etc. files and Black on your staged Python files. If any files are reformatted, the commit will be aborted, allowing you to `git add` the changes and commit again. üëç

### \#\# 3. Configure Your Code Editor (VS Code Example)

For a smooth development experience, you'll want your editor to format files automatically on save, using the correct tool for each language.

1.  **Install Extensions:**

      * [**Prettier - Code Formatter**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): The official Prettier extension.
      * [**Python** by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): This extension provides Black formatting support.

2.  **Configure Workspace Settings:** Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project to configure format-on-save and assign the correct default formatter for each language.

    ```json
    {
      // Enable format on save for all files
      "editor.formatOnSave": true,

      // --- Language-Specific Formatter Settings ---

      // Set Prettier as the default for JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.
      "[javascript]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
      },
      "[typescript]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
      },
      "[json]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
      },
      "[markdown]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
      },

      // Set Black as the default for Python
      "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter"
      }
    }
    ```

With this setup, your project is now configured to use Prettier and Black seamlessly together, both automatically in your git workflow and interactively in your code editor.
